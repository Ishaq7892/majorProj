# AI Traffic Prediction - User Guide

## Overview
The AI Prediction page provides intelligent traffic forecasting and route recommendations based on historical data analysis and pattern recognition.

## Features

### 1. 📊 24-Hour Traffic Forecast (Smart Time Predictions)

**What it does:**
- Predicts traffic levels for every hour of the day
- Shows density percentages
- Displays confidence scores
- Uses 30 days of historical data

**How to use:**
1. Navigate to **AI Prediction** page
2. Select an area from the dropdown
3. View hourly predictions in a grid format
4. Each hour shows:
   - Time (12:00 AM - 11:00 PM)
   - Traffic level (Low/Medium/High)
   - Density percentage
   - Confidence score

**Color Coding:**
- 🟢 **Green (Low)**: Clear roads, < 35% density
- 🟡 **Yellow (Medium)**: Moderate traffic, 35-65% density
- 🔴 **Red (High)**: Heavy congestion, > 65% density

**Example:**
```
8:00 AM
HIGH
75% density
85% confidence
```

This means at 8 AM, expect heavy traffic with 75% road density and the system is 85% confident in this prediction.

### 2. 📅 Weekly Traffic Patterns (Weekly Pattern Analysis)

**What it does:**
- Analyzes traffic patterns for each day of the week
- Identifies peak hours for each day
- Shows average density levels
- Helps plan your week

**How to use:**
1. Select an area
2. Scroll to "Weekly Traffic Patterns" section
3. View a card for each day of the week showing:
   - Day name
   - Average traffic level
   - Average density
   - Peak hour

**Insights:**
- **Weekdays (Mon-Fri)**: Typically higher traffic during rush hours
- **Weekends (Sat-Sun)**: Generally 15% lower density
- **Peak Hours**: Usually 7-10 AM and 5-8 PM on weekdays

**Example:**
```
Monday
MEDIUM
Avg: 55% density
Peak: 6:00 PM
```

This tells you Monday has moderate traffic with an average of 55% density, peaking at 6 PM.

### 3. 🎯 Route Recommendations (Real-time Recommendations)

**What it does:**
- Provides intelligent route suggestions for all areas
- Compares current vs. predicted traffic
- Suggests alternative routes
- Updates in real-time

**How to use:**
1. Click "Refresh" to get latest recommendations
2. View recommendations for all areas
3. Each recommendation shows:
   - ✅ **Ideal Route**: Clear roads, proceed
   - ⚠️ **Proceed with Caution**: Moderate traffic
   - 🚫 **Avoid**: Heavy congestion, use alternatives

**Recommendation Types:**

#### Ideal Route 🟢
- Current traffic is low
- Good time to travel
- Example: "Clear roads (25% density)"

#### Proceed with Caution 🟡
- Moderate traffic expected
- Plan extra time
- Example: "Moderate now, but expect heavy traffic in 1 hour"

#### Avoid Route 🔴
- Heavy congestion
- Alternative routes suggested
- Example: "Heavy traffic expected (82% density)"
  - Alternatives: Gokulam, Kuvempunagar

**Reading a Recommendation:**
```
KRS Road                          [AVOID]

## How AI Predictions Work

### Data Sources
1. **Historical Traffic Data**: Past 30 days of camera-captured traffic
2. **Time Patterns**: Rush hours, off-peak hours, night time
3. **Day of Week**: Weekday vs. weekend patterns
4. **Area Characteristics**: Highway, residential, commercial, etc.

### Prediction Algorithm
```
Base Density (from historical data)
↓
+ Time-based adjustments (rush hour +40%, night -50%)
↓
+ Day-of-week adjustments (weekend -15%)
↓
+ Area type adjustments (highway +10%, residential -10%)
↓
= Final Traffic Prediction
```

### Confidence Scores
- **90-100%**: Very High - Based on abundant data
- **70-89%**: High - Good data availability
- **50-69%**: Medium - Limited data
- **30-49%**: Low - Minimal data, using typical patterns
- **< 30%**: Very Low - Default patterns only

## Tips for Better Predictions

### Upload More Data
- More historical data = Better predictions
- Upload data regularly
- Include varied times (morning, afternoon, evening)

### Check Confidence
- Higher confidence = More reliable
- Low confidence? Cross-check with current traffic
- Build your own experience over time

### Update Regularly
- Predictions update when you select different areas
- Click "Refresh" on recommendations
- Check before each trip

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No prediction data available"
**Cause**: Insufficient historical data
**Solution**: Upload traffic data via Upload page

### Low Confidence Scores
**Cause**: Limited data for specific hours
**Solution**: Upload more data for those time periods

### Recommendations Not Updating
**Solution**: Click "Refresh" button in recommendations card

---

## Technical Details
