## Phase 7 Security Enhancements

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the EasyWay application during Phase 7.

## Database Security

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

All database tables are protected with strict RLS policies:

#### 1. **Areas Table**
- Public read access (SELECT)
- Insertions blocked for all users - managed by system only
- Prevents malicious users from creating fake geographic areas

#### 2. **Traffic Data Table**
- Public read access (SELECT)
- Insertions only allowed for authenticated users with active uploads
- Validation: Must have a processing upload record within 1 hour
- Constraint: Density score must be between 0-100

#### 3. **Traffic Analytics Table**
- Public read access (SELECT)
- All insertions and updates blocked for users
- Analytics generated only through secure server-side functions

#### 4. **User Roles Table**
- Users can only view their own roles (SELECT)
- All INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations blocked
- Prevents privilege escalation attacks

#### 5. **User Profiles Table**
- Users can only view their own profile (SELECT)
- Users can insert and update their own profile only
- No public access to user information

#### 6. **User Uploads Table**
- Users can only view/insert/update their own uploads (SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE)
- Tied to authenticated user via auth.uid()

### Security Definer Functions

Two critical functions created with SECURITY DEFINER to safely handle data operations:

1. **`insert_traffic_data_from_upload(p_user_id, p_records)`**
   - Validates user has an active upload (within 1 hour)
   - Prevents unauthorized data insertion
   - Validates all records before insertion

2. **`generate_analytics_safe(...)`**
   - Handles analytics generation server-side
   - Prevents user manipulation of analytics data
   - Uses UPSERT to avoid duplicates

## Input Validation

### File Upload Security

**FileUpload Component (`src/components/ui/file-upload.tsx`)**:
- File size validation (minimum 100 bytes, maximum 20MB)
- File extension whitelist (.xlsx, .xls)
- Path traversal prevention (checks for `..`, `/`, `\\`)
- Sanitized file names

### Excel Parser Security

**Excel Parser (`src/lib/excel-parser.ts`)**:
- Area name sanitization and length limits (2-100 characters)
- Strict density score validation (0-100 range)
- Timestamp validation
- Malformed data rejection

### Map Component Security

**MapComponent (`src/components/map/MapComponent.tsx`)**:
- XSS prevention via input sanitization
- Secure window.open with noopener and noreferrer
- URL encoding for external links

## Authentication Security

### Supabase Auth Configuration

**Auth Context (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)**:
- Email validation using Zod schema
- Minimum password length: 6 characters
- Email redirect URL properly configured
- Error handling for common auth issues

**Input Validation (`src/pages/Auth.tsx`)**:
- Client-side validation with Zod
- User-friendly error messages
- Protection against common auth errors

### Password Protection

**⚠️ Action Required**: Enable Leaked Password Protection in Supabase:
1. Go to Authentication settings in Supabase Dashboard
2. Enable "Leaked Password Protection"
3. This prevents users from using compromised passwords

## Performance Optimizations

### React Router Future Flags
- Enabled `v7_startTransition` for smooth transitions
- Enabled `v7_relativeSplatPath` for better routing

### Error Boundaries
- Global error boundary to catch runtime errors
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic recovery with home navigation

### PWA Enhancements
- Service worker for offline functionality
- Cache strategy for static assets
- Progressive loading of resources

## Database Performance

### Indexes Created
- `idx_traffic_data_area_timestamp` - Optimizes traffic data queries
- `idx_traffic_analytics_area_date` - Speeds up analytics lookups
- `idx_user_uploads_user_status` - Improves upload tracking

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. **Principle of Least Privilege**
- Users can only access their own data
- System functions handle sensitive operations
- No direct database modification by users

### 2. **Defense in Depth**
- Multiple layers of validation (client and server)
- RLS policies + application logic
- Input sanitization at every entry point

### 3. **Secure by Default**
- All new policies are restrictive
- Explicit allow lists instead of deny lists
- Safe defaults for all operations

### 4. **Data Integrity**
- Database constraints for valid ranges
- Foreign key relationships
- Transaction handling in functions

## Remaining Security Considerations

### To Enable in Supabase Dashboard:

1. **Leaked Password Protection**
   - Path: Authentication > Settings > Password Protection
   - Enable: "Prevent use of compromised passwords"

2. **Email Verification** (Optional for testing)
   - Path: Authentication > Settings > Email Auth
   - Enable: "Confirm email" for production

## Security Monitoring

Recommended ongoing security practices:

1. **Regular Security Scans**
   - Run Supabase security linter periodically
   - Review RLS policies during updates

2. **Audit Logs**
   - Monitor user_uploads table for unusual activity
   - Track failed authentication attempts

3. **Rate Limiting** (Future Enhancement)
   - Implement rate limiting for file uploads
   - Add CAPTCHA for auth forms if needed

## Incident Response

If a security issue is discovered:

1. Disable affected functionality immediately
2. Review database logs for exploitation
3. Apply security patches
4. Notify affected users if data was compromised
5. Update this document with lessons learned

## Compliance

The application implements security measures aligned with:
- OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks
- OWASP API Security Top 10
- General data protection best practices
