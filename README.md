## 🔐 Security Configuration

### Required Setup in Supabase Dashboard

1. **Enable Leaked Password Protection**
   - Go to: Authentication > Settings > Password Protection
   - Enable: "Prevent use of compromised passwords"
   - Documentation: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/password-security

   - Enable: "Confirm email"

## 📊 Database Schema

### Tables
- `areas` - Geographic locations
- `traffic_data` - Historical traffic records
- `traffic_analytics` - Aggregated traffic insights
- `user_uploads` - File upload tracking
- `user_roles` - User role management
- `profiles` - User profile information

### Secure Functions
- `insert_traffic_data_from_upload()` - Validates and inserts traffic data
- `generate_analytics_safe()` - Generates traffic analytics
- `has_role()` - Checks user roles
- `handle_new_user()` - Creates user profile on signup

## 🚀 Deployment

Simply open [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/projects/39c5a072-ebc2-4edf-afdd-7e9dc4922d94) and click on Share -> Publish.

The application is configured for deployment with:
- PWA manifest for mobile installation
- Service worker for offline functionality
- Optimized build with code splitting
- SEO-friendly meta tags

## 📱 PWA Features

- Install on mobile devices
- Offline functionality for cached pages
- App-like experience
- Push notifications (future enhancement)

## 🎨 Design System

The application uses a semantic color system defined in `src/index.css`:
- Traffic Clear: `hsl(142, 71%, 45%)` - Green
- Traffic Moderate: `hsl(38, 92%, 50%)` - Orange  
- Traffic Heavy: `hsl(0, 84%, 60%)` - Red

All components use these semantic tokens for consistent theming.

## 🧪 Testing

To test the application:
1. Create a user account
2. Upload sample traffic data (use the sample template)
3. View analytics and traffic status
4. Test on mobile devices
5. Check PWA installation
